          <h5>Brand Environment</h5>

          <p>
            IT revolution has changed the business dynamics and market geographies. The world markets have emerged to
            new opportunities for growth. In this scenario, it is universally acknowledged that only those companies
            with a powerful brand succeed in the market place.
          </p>

          <p>
            A product or service is the starting point for the branding process. Product or a type of service is a broad
            term; it includes goods, services, experiences, events, persons, places, properties, organizations or ideas.
            All these are needs and brands fulfills these needs. So, these brands have certain attributes, features, and
            functionality. Each brand commands a certain level of quality and reputation based on its generic tangible
            features, experiential features, and non-tangible perceptions. Customer develops perceptions like Quality
            Perception, Value Perception, etc. around the brand and relates with respective brands depending on its
            overall market performance.
          </p>

          <h5>Brand Features </h5>
          <h6>Generic Tangible Features</h6>
          <p>Function, Packaging, Design, Functional Attributes, Price</p>

          <h6>Experiential Features </h6>
          <p>Availability, During Sales, Credit &amp; Financing, Delivery, Guarantees, Warranties, After Sales Service
          </p>

          <h6>Non-tangible Perceptions</h6>
          <p>Quality Perception, Value Perception, Personality, Word of Mouth, Culture, Reputation Corporate Image
            (Company behind the brand)</p>

          <h5>What is Brand?</h5>
          <p>
            The word 'Brand' is quite comprehensive and covers several other narrower terms.
            <strong>A brand is defined as "a name, term, sign, symbol or special design or some combination of these
              elements that is intended to identify the goods or services of one seller or group of sellers. A brand
              differentiates these products from those of competitors"</strong> <i>(As defined by American Marketing
              Association of Chicago, USA)</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            A brand mark is the visual representation of the brand, like symbol, design, distinctive coloring or
            lettering. For example, ‘Ashok Leyland’ is a brand name and ‘L’ in a wheel graphic is a brand mark. A ‘Tread
            Mark’ is a brand that is legally protected. All trademarks are brands and include both the brand name and
            the brand marks in its pictorial presentation. Exclusive rights to use of the brand in permanency are
            granted by the trademark law, unlike the Patents and Copyright Laws which have an expiry date.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Essentially, a brand is a promise of the seller to deliver a specific set of benefits or attributes
              or service to the buyer.</strong> Each brand represents a level of quality. Irrespective of the fact from
            whom the brand is purchased, this level of quality can be expected of the brand. A brand is much more
            complex. Apart from attributes and benefits, it also reflects other aspects;
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Values:</strong> The values which govern a producer are reflected by the brand. Thus Tata stands for
            Quality, Fair Price, etc.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Culture:</strong> A brand also represents a certain culture, e.g., Maruti Car or Bajaj Scooter is
            an Indian culture which represents the affordability and value for money, while Ford Luxury car or Harley
            Davidson Motorbike is typically an icon of high priced and luxury brands of American Culture.</p>


          <p><strong>Personality:</strong> A brand projects a personality, e.g., MRF suggests a muscle man relating to
            their product attributes, i.e., strong, rugged, reliable, etc. or Rin Detergent suggests a Lighting flash
            relating the product attributes like super clean, quick, fresh, etc.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>User:</strong> The brand suggests its target audience. We know that Bajaj Sunny is for teenagers. We
            expect a Mercedes to be driven by a top-class businessman.
          </p>

          <p>In short, a brand is a complex symbol. It is not just a name. Branding, therefore, involves deeper meanings
            for the brand. The lesser the dimensions a brand possesses, the shallower it is. The more the dimensions,
            the deeper it is. Thus, it cannot be just a bundle of physical attributes. Attributes are very easy to copy.
            Brands become enduring by its values, culture, and personality. </p>

          <h5>Building Successful Brands</h5>
          <p>
            Brands and Business Success are correlated. Brands facilitate better demand management and thus improved
            profitability than commodities. Brands can be successful or unsuccessful. Only successful brands contribute
            to profit by adding values which attract consumers to buy. The improved scenario of business provides a
            sound framework to do business expansion. Brands also give some aspirational identity like a face to
            identify with it.
          </p>

          <h5>Characteristics of Brands</h5>
          <p>
            Four levels of Brand Characteristics;
          </p>

          <p><strong>Generic:</strong> It is the commodity level which satisfies the basic need of the consumer, e.g.,
            traveling from one place to another place by using a car.</p>

          <p><strong>Expected:</strong> A generic level is modified to satisfying some minimum buying conditions such as
            functional performance, pricing, availability, etc. </p>

          <p><strong>Augmented:</strong> Brand is further elevated by adding non-functional values along with the
            functional ones by positioning the brand as a social prestige, luxury or an upmarket icon. </p>

          <p><strong>Potential:</strong> As the brand evolves, we become more critical. Creativity plays an important
            role to grow up the brand to its full potential. Creativity in product features like entertainment coupled
            with luxury, temperature control, etc. along with brand positioning as 'A Personal Car with Personalised
            Luxury' can achieve the full potential of the brand.</p>

          <h5>5 Pillars of Brand Identity <small>(Visual InfoGraphic)</small></h5>
          <h6>Brand Values</h6>
          <p>
            Brand values create a perception of uniqueness. These values also increase the perceived value to the
            customer. In short, brand values are utilities that create the desired brand identity, brand image and brand
            get recognized or perceived around these values.
          </p>

          <p>For example;<br />

            Tata – Indian, Reliable, Trustworthy, Quality, Fair Price <br /> Apple – Quality, Technologically Superior,
            Status, Fast, Reliable</br /> Narendra Modi – Visionary, Trustworthy, Hard Work, Sincerity, Ethical </p>






        </div>


        <div class="blog-description col-md-6">
          <h6>Brand Promise</h6>
          <p>The brand promise is that core quality which brand fulfills as functional, experiential or
            self-expressive benefits. e.g., Lux promises ‘Beauty of Complexion’ which gets reciprocated by the consumer
            as their delight. Also, it is a promise that differentiates itself from its competitors’ brands.</p>

          <h6>Brand Personality</h6>
          <p>Every brand qualifies with a unique personality – a friendly brand, a serious brand, a youth brand, a macho
            brand, a stylish brand and so on. It reciprocates the brand's core values and characteristics which reflects
            in the consumer perceptions about the brand.</p>

          <h6>Brand Positioning</h6>
          <p>It is a unique brand promise which differentiates itself from the competitive brand. The brand promise is
            formed through well-strategized communication and promotion campaign. It is the desired perception of the
            brand-consumer forms in their minds concerning competitive brands. </p>


          <h6>Brand Equity</h6>
          <p>Brand equity is a commercial value of a brand coming from expectations, experiences and perceptions. The
            Brand value can be premium which consumer is willing to pay depending on his brand perception or his
            fulfillment of the brand promise. The brand equity is a store-house of its goodwill. </p>

          <h5>Brand Names</h5>
          <p>A brand name is a summary of all that brand stand for, i.e., its features, its ideology, its core promise
            or its characteristics. A brand name is there to stay for a very long period, and as it resides in the
            memory of the customers, it must be kept alive by all the means of communication and promotion. Naming a
            brand name is not easy. It reciprocates the entire gamut of brand objectives. An appropriate brand name
            reinforces the brand’s desired positioning, by associating it with the relevant attributes which influence
            the buying decision. </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              So, in short, the brand name should be simple but meaningful, short but long-lasting and unique but
              universally applicable which enables brand owners to weave stories around its promise and positioning.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <h5>Characteristics of a Good Brand Name</h5>
          <h6>Distinctive</h6>
          <p>A unique and distinctive name is easy to remember, and the same gets associated quickly with its core
            promise. Today in the market there are many over-worked and over-used names. One has to come up with a
            unique name which differentiates easily with its competitors in the market clutter. For example, brand names
            like ‘Radio Mirchi’, ‘Maruti’ or ‘Snap Deal’ is unique and distinctive. </p>

          <h6>Simple</h6>
          <p>It is always better to have a brand name that is very simple and easy to read. Also, it should able to
            pronounce easily and spell universally. Nowadays people prefer names that derive from the real-world
            associations. </p>


          <h6>Meaningful</h6>
          <p>As explained above a brand name is a summary of all that brand stands for, i.e., its features, its
            ideology, its core promise or its characteristics so, ideally, a brand name should be such that it is
            suggestive of its desired personality. For example, the name ‘Promise’ is suggestive of assurance of tooth
            health. ‘VIP Classic’ for travelers is suggestive of superior quality for a distinct class of people.</p>


          <h6>Registrable</h6>
          <p>Brand name must be protectable under the laws of Trade Marks and Copyright. So, you need to check the
            availability of the chosen brand name for Tread Mark registration before finalizing and releasing the same.
          </p>

          <h6>Flexible</h6>
          <p>A brand name should not be very specific of the product or service concept, but it should be little
            flexible to adapt it to different market situations with new ideas or new product lines. In today's
            ever-changing market you need to have the flexibility to change or correct your business course to adjust
            with changing environments and evolving expectations from the brand.</p>

          <h6>Universal</h6>
          <p>While deciding on the brand name, you must consider its geographical market. It should sound right across
            the cultures and nations. One has to check the meaning of the name in different languages or across
            cultures. It may sound the same, but the meaning could be different. So, ideally, the brand name should be
            universally adaptable in different markets and should not clash with cultural beliefs or sentiments. </p>


          <h5>Tag Lines</h5>
          <p>
            A tagline is a summary of your brand promise. The tagline is that single message which consumer associate
